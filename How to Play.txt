How to play Cubix`s Cafe:

	- Use the arrow keys to move the player (yellow square).

	- Use 'space' to take the costumers' orders (costumers are white circles).

	- You can only take one order at the time.

	- Take the order to the counter where the bartender is (bartender is the green square and 

		the counter is the brown polygon).

	- Use space again to place the order.

	- All actions involving 'space' require overlap of the interacting parts.

	- Clients' orders appear on screen as blue triangles, red rectangles and green ellipses.

	- When you take their orders, those figures will be drawn hollow.

	- When you place their orders correctly, the hollow figures will disappear.

	- The game ends when you successfully place three orders, no matter color or shape (for now).

	- A GG!(Great Game!) screen will show up indicating the game is over.


				Hope you enjoy this very simple game! :D
